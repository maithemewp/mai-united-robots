		  "Sub-freezing temperatures as low as 27 possible for portions of Delaware, the eastern shores of Maryland, New Jersey, and southeast Pennsylvania from late Wednesday night through Thursday morning.",

		  "<h3>Freeze watch or warning - this is what it means</h3>",
		  "Freeze warnings are issued from May to October (but can be extended if necessary), when low temperatures are expected to be 29-32 degrees. If there is a potential for temperatures to fall into these thresholds, a freeze watch may be issued a few days ahead of time.",
		  "According to the weather service, if a freeze warning or watch is issued for your area, there is little you can do to protect plants. If you can move your sensitive plants inside, do so because the freeze will likely kill them, depending on the severity of conditions.",
